# 1st_AI
My first attempt at creating an AI
The inputs(list "I") are random and are only for testing.
Uses RELU(Rectified Linear) activation function to calculate/modify inputs going into a hidden layer.
Uses SoftMax activation function for the output(final) layer.
Haven't gotten to finishing the Cross Entropy loss function.
